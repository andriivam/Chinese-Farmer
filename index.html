          Up in space, turning around, looking at the earth’s face. From that
          rock’s perspective on Mars or that gaz opinion from Jupiter, nothing
          cares about your problems. Up there, it’s just not serious, and
          there’s no such thing as an issue.

          Down here, the only reality is the one inside our brain. Nothing
          exists if the brain doesn’t think it. Nothing exists neither if our
          senses don’t transmit the message. That means that if we mis sense,
          our reality changes. That’s possible because our perception is limited
          : you can’t see at 360 degrees for example. If we mis translate the
          message, our reality changes. If we think it in a way, our reality
          changes depending on that way. Therefore, if we can change reality
          that much, everything’s fake.

          They’re proofs to that. Fall in love with someone and you’ll see that
          person as divine. Pull yourself out of that grip and the divine falls
          from clouds to solid ground, revealing him or herself differently. But
          the person is the same, you just changed your mind. Everything works
          like that : it’s not just that you can make your world, it’s that you
          passively do it anyway

            Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That
            evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said:
            <q class="village"
              >We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most
              unfortunate.</q
            >
            The farmer said:
            <q class="farmer">
              Is it <span class="good">Good</span> ? Is it
              <span class="bad">Bad</span>? I don't know.</q
            >
            The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and
            in the evening everybody came back and said:
            <q class="village"
              >Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight
              horses!</q
            >
            The farmer again said:
            <q class="farmer"
              >Is it <span class="good">Good</span>? Is it
              <span class="bad">Bad</span> ? I don't know.</q
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while
            riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said,
            <q class="village">Oh dear, that’s too bad,</q> and the farmer
            responded:<q class="farmer"
              >Is it <span class="good">Good</span>? Is it
              <span class="bad">Bad</span>? I don't know.</q
            >
            The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people
            into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg.
            Again all the neighbors came around and said:
            <q class="village">Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said:
            <q class="farmer"
              >Is it <span class="good">Good</span>? Is it
              <span class="bad">Bad</span>? I don't know.</q

      The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense
      complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that
      happens in it is good or bad — because you never know what will be the
      consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the
      consequences of good fortune.

      <h3>Here is this dialog in the form of a table</h3>
      <h5>Table representing the farmer's philosophy.</h5>

          <th>Good or Bad ?</th>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <blockquote>
        Good and Bad are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but
        monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...
